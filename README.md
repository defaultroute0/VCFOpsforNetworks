## vRNI Trial Process <a name="overview"></a>

The first step is to register for the VRNI trial and download the appliance files.  
You can then copy the OVAs onto a vSphere Datastore in your management environment ready to go, as this will greatly simplify the process.  

Also - please read the pre-requisites below as they relate to product versions, vCenter permissions, and the Distributed Switch.  

To get access software trials /  OVA's and Trial Key you can go here:
http://support.broadcom.com/

To download the appliances (and get the license key), you can sign in using your my.vmware.com credentials.
If you do not have a my.vmware.com account - select "create an account" to register first.

You will then get access to download the latest vRNI OVAs:
- VMware-vRealize-Network-Insight-X.X.X.XXXXXXXXXX-platform.ova
- VMware-vRealize-Network-Insight-X.X.X.XXXXXXXXXX-proxy.ova

Main documentation page:  
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Network-Insight/index.html

### vRNI Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
For the vRNI trial, there are 2x OVA images (mentioned above) to be imported into a vSphere environment.  
These will be configured to begin collecting vCenter inventory and VDS flow information from the virtual environment.  

Please take a look at the pre-requisites below.

To set up these VMs - you will require:
1. 2x static IP addresses to be allocated from a MGMT environment (1 IP per VM)
2. VMs to be imported into a MGMT environment (OVAs to be copied over to vCenter datastore first, but not yet deployed)
3. These IP addresses require connectivity/access (L2 or L3) to the MGMT network of vCenter and ESX host mgmt VMK ports.
	
	```
	ESXi Hosts -> Collector VM (UDP 2055).
	Collector VM  -> vCentre (TCP 443).
	Collector VM -> Platform VM (TCP 443).
	https://ports.vmware.com/home/vRealize-Network-Insight
	```
	
4. Environment must be using the Distributed Virtual Switch
5. vCenter Server credentials with privileges:
- Distributed Switch: Modify
- dvPort group: Modify

More details on permissions here:  
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Network-Insight/6.4/com.vmware.vrni.install.doc/GUID-F4F34425-C40D-457A-BA65-BDA12B3ABE45.html

6. Once installed - the vRNI Platform will modify and enable IPFIX flows on the VDS
- This will be a change (although non-impacting) - please ensure any change control items are covered  
- Verify current ESX VDS IPFIX configuration before proceeding

From here we can:
- Create some high level VM 'Application' grouping constructs
- Typically gather data for 3-5 days (or more) and generate reports for app dependencies, routed, switched etc..
- Plan logical constructs for a transition to NSX

Here are the vRNI VM requirements (refer to Install documentation below):

vRealize Network Insight **Platform** OVA (XL):  
- 18 cores - Reservation 100%
- 64 GB RAM - Reservation - 100%
- 2 TB - HDD, Thin provisioned

** N.B: To use 'Flow based Application Discovery' OR  'Network Intents and Assurance'- use XL Brick size for the platform (18 core / 64GB RAM / 2TB disk)
Basically if you are evaluating how machine learning can disovery applications, its a must to check this out.
https://youtu.be/bqZSBwv55vk

vRealize Network Insight **Collector** OVA (XL):  
- 9 cores - Reservation 100%
- 24 GB RAM - Reservation - 100%
- 200 GB - HDD, Thin provisioned

VMware vCenter Server (version 5.5+ and 6.0+):
- To configure and use IPFIX

VMware ESXi:
- 5.5 Update 2 (Build 2068190) and above
- 6.0 Update 1b (Build 3380124) and above

Full list of supported data sources:

VMware Tools ideally installed on all the virtual machines in the data center.  
This helps in identifying the VM to VM traffic.  

### Installation Steps <a name="installation"></a>

I would usually block out a morning or afternoon (around 2 hours) to complete this.  
If you have already copied the VMs to vCenter this can be < 1 hour.

vRealize Network Insight Install Documentation:  
https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vrealize-network-insight-pubs.html

This covers the install process - fairly straight forward.

1. Import Platform VM OVA and power up
2. Connect HTTPS to Platform VM and run through wizard using admin@local as login and your password you set
3. Enter License Key - this is for the 60-day trial
4. Generate shared key from Platform VM
5. Import Proxy VM and enter shared key
6. Finalise Proxy install via setup CLI
7. Login to Platform VM UI (HTTPS) admin@local and configure vCenter / VDS datasources (IPFIX)

## General Queries <a name="general"></a>

vRNI is a big data analytics set of of end to end environment, physical, virtual, AWS, NSX-T, Nexus Switches, ASA Palo firewalls as an example. It's the context of all this against real metrics / network flows which provides great insight to networks, security, operations, and cloud teams. 

Apart from the many dashboards the system provides by default, The usefulness of these custom outputs is only as good as the questions asked of the system, as constructed via **queries**

nsx policy group where member is set group by member
show  Firewall Rule Masked Alert // SHows shadow rules security gaps etc 

These type of queries will give exact duplicate for SG/Services have single member/port.
For multi member/ports, the above query may provide partial overlapping result, but not convey if its exact duplicate. While Aria Operations for Networks can give you a members list, one could use a script to iterate through all the results and compare to check for duplicates.  Members can be various objects, not just an IP or VM, it could be another tag/security group that you would need to go investigate as well

Another possibility is to use firewall rule CSV export feature documented at https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations-for-Networks/6.10/Using-Operations-for-Networks/GUID-FF803835-0409-4ACB-95AC-91428541C4CB.html . It contains additional information like source/ dest IPs, service ports etc. , which can be used to group similar firewall rules in Excel. Do note that the IPs/ports are not sorted and  based on the order as seen in firewall rule configuration

#### Moving, Migrating Applications <a name="migration"></a>
When doing multiple applications and forming Move Groups, create a parent container application called ‘Move_Group_1’ and make the specific applications a part of it. Then use the group name in the below searches. Ref: https://cloud.vmware.com/community/2019/12/10/planning-application-migration-vmware-cloud-aws-vrealize-network-insight-cloud/

#### Virtual Network Assessment <a name="vna"></a>
Analyses Traffic Patterns to ascertain E/W flows and flows which may happen solely with a security zone, which often has has no security visiblity and / or enforcement., thus presenting, a pivot point or later move for an attacker.

[[https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud/2019/12/10/planning-application-migration-vmware-cloud-aws-vrealize-network-insight-cloud]

```
Identify is customer using a fwd proxy as N/S % flows will be distorted, if so, enter it as N/S destination in settings
Use application definition to identify DEV, or even better additionally PROD and Crown Jewel DB groupings so we can see incoming flows
or just manually create an app group 'custom vm search' name like dev
vm where name like DEV
vm where name like SQL
top50 flows where destination country != 'Australia' group by source vm, destination country order by sum(Bytes) in last 30 days
flows where source application = 'PROD' and destination application = 'DEV' or source application = 'DEV' and destination application = 'PROD'
flows where source application = 'DEV' and destination application != 'DEV'
flows where flow type = 'source is internet' and port in (22,23,3389) group by source country, destnation vm
flows where flow type = 'destination is internet' in last 30 days group by application
flows where flow type = 'source is internet' in last 30 days group by application
flows where source application = 'DEV - ALL' and destination application != 'DEV - ALL' in last 30 days
plan application 'CrownJewelDB'
flows where port = 3389 group by application
flows where port = 3389 and destination application = 'CrownJewelDB' in last 30 days
flows where destination port = 3389 and destination application = 'CrownJewelDB' in last 30 days

## Using vRNI via its API <a name="api"></a>
See pythonexamples subfolder also
https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/tree/master/pythonexamples

Step by step instructions for setting up postman and interacting with vRNI's OpenAPI spec

![API method](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/image.png?raw=true)

Use the OpenAPI spec 3.0 json and import this into postman
https://yourvrni.yourdomain.com/doc-api/swagger-config.json

or

https://github.com/vrealize-network-insight/vrni-api-postman-collection

Import these two files as raw github links / URLs into postman
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrealize-network-insight/vrni-api-postman-collection/master/vrni-6.5.0-api-postman-collection.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrealize-network-insight/vrni-api-postman-collection/master/vrni-6.5.0-api-postman-environment.json
```
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/postmancollection.png?raw=true)

Set the “host” parameter in environment as your vRNI setup IP.
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/postmanenv.png?raw=true)

Leave parent auth method as no auth for collection
This collection has an auth folder. In the “Create an auth token” call, change the body with the vRNI login credentials and you will get the token.

Either use my LDAP one pictured below, or just use LOCAL example

```
                      "username": "admin@local",
                      "password": "testpassword",
                      "domain": {
                       "domain_type": "LOCAL"
```

Create an auth token
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/createauthtoken.png?raw=true)	      
		      
Come back to vrni env collection and change the token param manually to the newly returned token you got (my example as pictured above)
or
place this code in 'Tests' section of postman for the POST
```
var responseJson = JSON.parse(responseBody);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("AuthenticationToken", responseJson.token);
```		      
	
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/autotoken.png?raw=true)
		
Then you can send API calls into vRNI while the token lasts for the whole collection

Create PIN board example, noting ‘id’
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/createpinboard.png?raw=true)

Then using PINboard  ID in env param to set some content
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/createapin.png?raw=true)

Hope this shows you a quick example of way you can drive pinboards and their content for specific users via API method

You can see OpenAPI spec documentation live in the product here:
![API method coming soon](https://github.com/defaultroute0/vrni/blob/master/images/openapispec.png?raw=true)
